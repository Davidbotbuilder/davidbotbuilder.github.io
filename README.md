### David Babikian

Hi there! I am building where bits meet atoms, shaped by tech, geopolitics, and climate futures. Background improving American manufacturing at Palantir, scaling a critical minerals/metals recovery startup, and at Battery Ventures.

Operational experience turning messy data into systems that ship -- building product, interfacing with clients, driving market strategy, and RevOps. I have consulted with an early-stage venture studio focused on building against atmospheric changes and extreme weather impacts and a $X00M AUM investment firm's portfolio companies in robotics and commodity processing.

Wrote [this article](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/nato-needs-a-strategy-to-address-russias-arctic-expansion/) in The Atlantic Council about the need to develop technologies suitable for the warming temperatures and tensions in the Arctic, and [this article](https://therepublicjournal.com/web-exclusives/fixing-americas-dry-bottleneck/) in The Republic (Palantir Foundation journal) about the need for national policy to incentivize water production over demand regulation.
